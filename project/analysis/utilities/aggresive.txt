OBJECTIVE & STRATEGY

Aggressive Portfolio is a strategy that seeks to achieve high (greater than the stock market as a whole) long-term appreciation in the value of its shares. The Aggressive portfolio invests in stocks and ETFs. The Portfolio may invest in shares of companies of any market capitalization, including small-, mid- and large-capitalization, however, at least 60% of its assets will ordinarily be invested in securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Aggressive Growth Portfolio expects to remain fully invested in stock market investments at all times.

Aggressive Portfolio seeks to invest in stocks and ETFs of U.S. and international companies that are expected to have a higher profit potential (and likely a higher volatility) than the stock market as a whole and whose shares are valued primarily for potential growth in revenues, earnings, dividends or asset values rather than for current income. Such companies may include those involved in technology, medicine, capital goods, natural resources, energy, construction, transportation,  nance, entertainment or service, those developing or exploiting new industries, products, services or markets, or those whose shares are otherwise undervalued.

Aggressive Portfolio is managed to reduce the tax burden on you, the investor. The Portfolio chooses investments for capital appreciation potential rather than for income and it plans investment purchases and sales, whenever practical, to minimize capital gain. In addition, the Portfolio reinvests its pro ts to achieve further gains and makes only the minimum taxable distributions required for it to qualify for the favorable tax treatment available to investment companies. All income and pro ts that are not distributed to you are added to the redemption value of your shares. The money is available to you at any time â€“ but is not subject to income tax until you decide to take it.
