OBJECTIVE & STRATEGY

Most conservative investors want their portfolios to provide them with an inflation-adjusted income stream to pay their living expenses. They're either currently depending on their investments to give them a retirement paycheck, or are expecting this to happen soon. Some are on tight budgets and are barely making a living as it is, so they are very afraid of losing what little money they have left. They do not have time to recoup any losses (because they can't go back to work for a multitude of reasons). Some realize they don't need their portfolio to provide income for more than several years, because of low life expectancy, so growth is not the objective.

The majority of their money should be held in cash and high-quality short- and intermediate-term maturity bonds. Very risky asset classes are typically avoided altogether.

Satisfying their needs is hard to achieve when inflation is high, or rising, because the market value of fixed income securities (bonds) typically are declining due to increasing interest rates. So investing defensively is not without risk. There is no way to eliminate all risks when investing.
