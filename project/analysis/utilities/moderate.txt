OBJECTIVE & STRATEGY

Balanced Portfolio is a strategy that suits the majority of investors who are in this middle-of-the-road category. The reasons for people to be in this category are too many to list here. The most-common is the desire to invest long-term for retirement or college funding. The current need for portfolio-generated income is usually several years away.

These investors want good returns, and know they're taking some risk to get them. They should expect returns similar to a basket of similarly weighted market indices. Their portfolio should go up less than the markets as a whole, but should also go down less when markets go down.

A Moderate portfolio will hold a balanced mix of most all-major viable asset classes (for maximum diversification), which will include conservatively-managed bond funds as well as high-risk stock funds. This category typically uses the largest number of asset classes to both reduce risk and increase profits. Both safe and risky asset classes are utilized pragmatically. Balance between profits and loss reduction is the goal.

They know they will lose money if the markets go down, but also expect to be along for the ride if they go up.

Moderate portfolios produce modest annual income yields - typically in the range of 2% to 3%.

Moderate portfolios produce a moderate amount of capital gains distributions.
