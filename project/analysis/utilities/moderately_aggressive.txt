OBJECTIVE & STRATEGY

If an investor wants to outperform a basket of similarly weighted indices when the markets are up, and does not mind too much being down a little more than the markets when they are down, then this is the category for them.

They are taking on more downside risk than the markets, but expect to be substantially ahead of the game when markets go up. Fixed income positions are minimized and risky asset classes are fully utilized. Most of the bond and international stock mutual funds in this portfolio are aggressively-managed.

These investors want to take the risks of winning the game by playing hard offense, but still don't want to lose too much in a short period of time. Most Moderately Aggressive investors want to accumulate a significant amount of wealth in the future, are willing to wait a significant amount of time for the rewards (and to recoup short-term losses), and have earned-income to contribute to the portfolio over time.

They know they will lose a high percentage of their money if the markets go down (more than the S&P 500), but also expect to profit greatly if they go up. More emphasis is put on making money than preventing the loss of money.

Moderately Aggressive portfolios produce the little annual income yields - typically in the range of 0.5% to 2%.

Moderately Aggressive portfolios produce a high amount of capital gains distributions.
